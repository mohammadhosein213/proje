            We are all familiar with the <span style="color: blue;">Minesweeper</span> game. In this project, you are
            asked to simulate this game in the console.<br><br>

            <img style="width: 100%;margin: 15px 0;border-radius: 15px;" src="./mal-sobl.jpg" alt="">

            <b style="font-size: 18px; color: green;">Rules</b><br>
            The rules of Minesweeper are very simple. The game board is divided into cells, with mines randomly
            distributed in some of them.
            Initially, we don't know which cells contain mines or are safe (unknown state). To win, you must reveal the
            status of all the cells.<br><br>

            The number on each cell represents the number of mines in the neighboring 8 cells. Using this information,
            you can identify safe cells
            and flag cells that contain mines.<br>

            <b style="width: 100%;text-align: right; font-size: 18px; color: green;">Required Structures</b><br>
            <b>Player Structure:</b><br>
            Username<br>
            Number of Wins<br>
            Number of Losses<br><br>

            <b>Game Board Structure:</b><br>
            Number of Rows<br>
            Number of Columns<br>
            Number of Mines<br>
            An array of all players (Player Structure)<br><br>

            In addition to these structures, you can create and use other structures if needed.<br><br>

            <b style="font-size: 18px; color: green;">Game Menu</b><br>
            In the initial game menu, there are three options:
            <b style="color: darkorange;">Start New Game</b>, <b style="color: darkorange;">View High Scores</b>, and
            <b style="color: darkorange;">Exit the Game</b>.
            The user selects an option to proceed to the respective section.
            Display the menu when the user makes a choice. You can implement the option selection however you prefer,
            such as by selecting a number or using the up/down keyboard keys.<br><br>

            After choosing to start a game, three other options become available for the user to choose from:<br>
            <span style="color: blue;">Easy</span> (Board size 9x9, 10 mines)<br>
            <span style="color: blue;">Medium</span> (Board size 16x16, 40 mines)<br>
            <span style="color: blue;">Hard</span> (Board size 16x30, 99 mines)<br><br>

            After exiting the game, all player data (including username and win/loss count) is saved to a file, and upon
            restarting, the data is read from the file and loaded into the program.<br><br>

            <b style="font-size: 18px; color: green;">Initial Game Setup</b><br>
            The game board is represented as a matrix. This matrix, based on the user's choice, has mines randomly
            placed in some cells.
            (You can represent the presence of a mine in a cell with a number.) Then, the remaining cells should display
            the number of neighboring mines.
            (The 8 cells that share a side or corner with this cell.)<br><br>

            <b style="font-size: 18px; color: green;">Running the Game</b><br>
            When the game starts, the game board should be displayed to the user. At any turn in the game, the user has
            four options:<br>
            1. Reveal a cell<br>
            2. Flag a cell<br>
            3. Remove the flag from a cell<br>
            4. Exit the game<br><br>

            If the first three options are selected, the user should be asked for the coordinates of the cell, and the
            corresponding action will be performed.
            If the exit option is selected, the game ends and returns to the main menu.<br><br>

            <b>Cell Statuses:</b><br>
            During the game, each cell will have one of three statuses:<br>
            Hidden: Instead of the cell value, a hidden character (like <span style="color: gray;">*</span>) is
            displayed.<br>
            Revealed: Revealed cells without mines display a number showing how many adjacent mines there are.<br>
            Flagged: Instead of the cell value, a flagged character (like <span style="color: red;">^</span>) is
            displayed.<br><br>

            The game ends when all non-mine cells are revealed, or the user selects a mine cell and loses the game.<br>
